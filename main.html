	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm as a function of the length of the input. It is a crucial aspect to consider when designing efficient algorithms, as it helps determine the feasibility and performance of the algorithm in practice.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the length of the input. An algorithm with a space complexity of O(n) means that the amount of memory required grows linearly with the input size.</p>
